# Percolation
CSIS-2420-403 A01 Java project
two classes created to solve the percolation assignment
Percolation: using a 2-dimentional boolean array, a Weighted QuickUnionUF object with N^2 real sites + two virtual sites(to resolve percolation calls)
and a WeightedQuickUnionUF object with N^2 real sites + one virtual site( to resolve full calls)
and PercolationStats: an array of size T to store the results of each experiment 
Four doubles to store the statistics results and two ints to store the grid size and number of experiments
